// Recap

// To analyze the performance of an algorithm, we use big O notation
// Big O notation can give us a high level understanding of the time or space complexity of an alg.
// Big O notation doesnt care about precision, only about general trends (linear, quadratic, constant, etc)
// time or space complexity (as measured by Big O) depends only on algo, not hardware that runs algo
