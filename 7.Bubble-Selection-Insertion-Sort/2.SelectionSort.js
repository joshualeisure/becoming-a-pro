// similiar to bubble, but instead of first palcing large values into sorted posiont, it places small vlas into sorted position

// How to implement
// Store the first element as the smallest value you've seen so far.
// Compare this item to the next item in the array until you find a smaller number.
// If a smaller number is found, designate that smaller number to be the new "minimum" and continue until the end of the array.
// If the "minimum" is not the value (index) you initially began with, swap the two values.
// Repeat this with the next element until the array is sorted.
