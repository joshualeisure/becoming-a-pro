// UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM
// -- Can I restate the problem in my own words?
// -- What are the inputs that go into the problem?
// -- What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
// -- Can the outputs be determined from the inputs?
// ---> In other words, do I have enough information to solve the problem?
// ---> (You may not be able to answer this question until you set about solving the problem. That's okay!
// --->  it's still worth considering the question at this early stage.)
// -- How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?

// Write a function which takes two numbers and returns their sum.
// 1. implement addition
// 2. ints? floats? strings for large numbers?
// 3. int? float? string?
// 4.
// 5.
